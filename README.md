# Smart Attendance

As we all know,attendance plays a major role in the assessment of regularity and consistency of an individual working for an organization.There are many mediums in which the attendance can be taken,either manually or bio-metrically.In both the cases,we can find the management flaws.In order to avoid these issues,weâ€™ve come up with a new idea ie through face recognition.

### Some of the key features of our project are:
* Attendance through face scan.
* Attendance counts only when the individual is in the correct area of the allotted work.
* Monitoring individuals and their attendance and helping them out with their daily wages.
* It is less expensive.

### Some of the modules we use in our project are: 
* Advanced coreML module in iOS for face recognition
* CoreLocation to retrieve the data of the specific location coordinates.
* Firebase to store data.
* MapKit to show user location.
