# Smart Attendance

As we all know,attendance plays a major role in the assessment of regularity and consistency of an individual working for an organization.

There are many mediums in which the attendance can be taken,either manually or bio-metrically.In both the cases,we can find the management flaws.In order to avoid these issues,weâ€™ve come up with a new idea ie through face recognition.
Some of the key features of our project are:
1.Attendance through face scan
2.Attendance counts only when the individual is in the correct area of the allotted work.
3.Monitoring individuals and their attendance and helping them out with their daily wages
4.It is less expensive
Some of the modules we use in our project are:
-Advanced coreML module in iOS for face recognition
-CoreLocation to retrieve the data of the specific location coordinates and usage of hash set to store these values.
